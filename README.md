Simulation of Ballistic Shot using custom integration methods

Being aware of limitations upon Unity3d built-in physics engine I've simulated projectile using custom integration methods and combined results it with Unity3d Engine. The simulation takes regard of physical forces acting on a projectile such as aerodynamic drag and force due to wind.

In project I've used Signleton and Object Pooling design patterns.
